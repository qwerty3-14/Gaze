This is a Game I worked on in my Jr/Senior year of College, and became my senior project. It is heavily isnpired by the old star control games.

The game uses Monogame framework with Myra helping with UI.

The game used to use Lidgren for networking, but I am in the middle of replacing it with a more up to date networking library so network features currently don't work.


Here is a video showing what the game looks like:
